python3 -B main.py -v                                 # Verbose mode with detailed progress
python3 -B main.py --input path/to/files              # Specify custom input path
python3 -B main.py --output path/to/output            # Specify custom output path

python3 -B main.py --dry-run                          # Validation only, no files written

INPUT/OUTPUT:
- Place JSON files in INPUT/ folder (supports subdirectories)
- Converted files saved to OUTPUTS/CONVERTED/
- Failed files saved to:
  * PRE_CONVERSION_VALIDATION_FAILED/ (original files with blocking errors)
  * CONVERSION_FAILED/ (original files)
  * POST_CONVERSION_VALIDATION_FAILED/ (converted files)
- Error reports in LOGS_REPORTS/:
  * .xlsx with two sheets: "Errors" (blocking) and "Warnings" (non-blocking)
