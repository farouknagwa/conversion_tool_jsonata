FILE: main.py
PURPOSE: Main orchestrator for JSON conversion tool with CLI interface

FUNCTIONS:
- ConversionStats: Tracks conversion statistics (total, success, failures by type, errors)
- discover_json_files(input_path, filter_types): Recursively finds JSON files, optionally filters by question type
- process_file(filepath, output_dir, ...): Processes single file through validation-conversion-validation pipeline
- generate_excel_report(stats, output_path): Creates Excel report of all errors with columns (filename, question_id, error_type, etc.)
- generate_text_log(stats, output_path): Creates text log with summary and detailed errors
- main(): Entry point - parses CLI args, discovers files, processes batch, generates reports

CLI ARGUMENTS:
--input/-i: Input directory or file path (default: INPUT)
--output/-o: Output directory for converted files (default: OUTPUTS/CONVERTED)
--types/-t: Comma-separated question types to filter (e.g., counting,mcq)
--dry-run: Validation only mode, no files written
--verbose/-v: Detailed progress messages

OUTPUT DIRECTORIES:
- CONVERTED/: Successfully converted files
- PRE_CONVERSION_VALIDATION_FAILED/: Files that failed pre-validation (original copies)
- CONVERSION_FAILED/: Files that failed during conversion (original copies)
- POST_CONVERSION_VALIDATION_FAILED/: Files that failed post-validation (converted versions)
- LOGS_REPORTS/: Log files and Excel error reports

WORKFLOW:
1. Parse arguments and setup paths
2. Discover JSON files (with optional type filtering)
3. For each file: pre-validate → convert → post-validate → save to appropriate folder
4. Generate Excel and text reports with all errors
5. Exit with status code (0 = all success, 1 = some failures)

DEPENDENCIES: tqdm (progress bar), openpyxl (Excel reports), jsonata-python (via converter)
